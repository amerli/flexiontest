# Flexion Java Challenge

## Installing

Execute on the pluginapi maven project:
```
mvn install
mvn exec:java
```

## Built With

* Java 8
* Maven
* Additional Java libraries as Maven dependencies

## Testing

The project at the current state contains an integration test.
I would extend the current set of tests with unit tests to make sure the different units function separately and they work as it is expected.
I would also load test the application.
